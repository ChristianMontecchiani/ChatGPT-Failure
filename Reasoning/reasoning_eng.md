	- Continue with the next prime number, 5. Dividing 1541 by 5 gives us 308 with a remainder of 1.

	- Move on to the next prime number, 7. Dividing 1541 by 7 gives us 220 with a remainder of 1.

	- Continue with the next prime number, 11. Dividing 1541 by 11 gives us 140 with a remainder of 1.

	- Move on to the next prime number, 13. Dividing 1541 by 13 gives us 118 with a remainder of 5.
